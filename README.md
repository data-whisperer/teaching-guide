# Data Whispering: Teaching Guide

This guide provides an approach to delivering this curriculum to a group of people. It includes a sequence of topics/concepts and timings for lectures and exercises. This guide should include justification when applying sound pedagogical practices.

## Context

Hi, I'm Don. I'm building this course as a learning tool for my own learning. As a career software developer and educator, I've been paying close attention to how I learn for many years and am convinced that _learning with the goal of teaching_ is the most effective way to learn ... and I'd like to learn about data science. So in order for me to build the highest quality course I can, I'm going to have to learn quite a lot. So that's what this is, my data science learning journey.


## Other random thoughts

**Modules**: The entire course is broken down into modules. Each module should contain 4 main components:

  1. An introduction to the concepts: This can be delivered in a number of ways (text/reading, lecture, video, etc) and preferably more than one. This component will have a slide deck that serves to outline the concepts and provide a way to show visuals/animations to make the concepts easier to understand.
  1. An exercise/challenge: This is a hands-on exercise that requires the learner to write code, move data, set up something online, etc. This should take the learner between 2-3 hours to complete.
  1. A set of assessment questions: At least 6 questions that get to the core learning objectives of the module. Most of the time these will be multiple choice, but depending on the delivery mechanism of the assessments, there may be other options.
  1. Additional or related concepts: This component is to allow the module to be stretched to a whole day in case this is a module that justifies a deeper treatment or if the delivery is in a workshop or boot camp scenario. This content should contain additional bits of the first 3 components (introduction, challenge and questions). These concepts may extend to lower priority aspects of the morning concepts or the challenge may just provide more opportunity for repetition.

The sequence of modules during a delivery will be very important to ensure the right amount of interleaving, spacing, repetition and reflection.
